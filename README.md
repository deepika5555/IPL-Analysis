prediction of the winnig team in ipl using Decision tree
Given the batsmen and bowler order the decision tree predicts the runs and wickets fallen or not over by over
there are two models 
1) predicts the runs 
2) predicts whether wicket has fallen or not

details.csv contains the data that I used to train the model
i.e bowler cluster number,total wickets taken, economy rate, batsman 1cluster number, his strike rate, avg runs, batsman 2 cluster number, his strike rate, avg runs runs in the over and wickets taken in that ovet
